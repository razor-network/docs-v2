title: Reset Lock
---

### Reset lock needs to be done in following scenarios:

1. Consider user had unstaked in epoch `T`. After unstaking, users sRAZOR tokens are locked in the Stake Manager contract.
2. User needs to `Initiate Withdraw` after epoch `T + 1` and before `T + 151`, this is known as the `withdrawInitiationPeriod`.
3. If the user does not call initiate withdraw within this period (`T + 1` and `T + 151` window), then the user needs to reset unstake lock.

   **Note**: _Penalty will be charged to the user while reseting unstake lock, this penalty is proportional to the users funds being unstaked_.

### Step 4 {#step-4}

Click on Reset Lock in staker action dropdown and confirm the transaction. Now the unstake lock is reset, meaning the user will need to call `Initiate Withdraw` within the new withdrawInitiationPeriod set.

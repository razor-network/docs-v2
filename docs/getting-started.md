# Getting Started

Razor network is a proof of stake network. There are two ways in which anyone can participate in the network:

1. Staker
2. Delegator

## 1. Staker

- To participate in network, staker needs to stake $RAZOR tokens.
- After staking, staker can start validating transactions by running [Razor Node](razor-go/installation)
- Block reward will be awarded to staker on successful confirmation of block.
- Detailed guide regarding staking can be found [here](Stake).

## 2. Delegator

- Delegator can delegate $RAZOR tokens to existing staker to participate in network.
- Delegator gets a share of the block reward when the staker user has delegated to confirms a block.
- Detailed guide regarding delegating can be found [here](/docs/delegation/delegate).

title: Delegate
---

Razor network is a proof of stake network. In order to participate in the network as a delegator, you will need to "Delegate" your RAZORs. RAZOR is (`ERC20` token standard) the native token in Razor Network.

In order to delegate, you will also need some RAZORs on Razor Schain. You can bridge RAZOR tokens from Ethereum to Razor Schain using [Razor Token Bridge](https://bridge.razorscan.io/). More info regarding RAZOR Token bridge can be found [here](docs/token-bridge/intro). To pay transaction fees on Razor Schain you will require sFUEL to pay for gas, you can get sFUEL from [Faucet](https://faucet.razorscan.io/).

<!-- > Warning: Razor network is in alpha state and is deployed on Skale v2 Testnet. Please use Testnet tokens only. -->

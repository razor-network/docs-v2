## Voting on the snapshot proposal


<!-- > Note: If you hold $RAZOR tokens in your wallet and are not affiliated as either a staker or a delegator, kindly advance directly to [Step 2](#step-2). -->

### Steps

    - If you're a Validator, access your profile page.
    - If you're a Delegator, navigate to a stakers page that you have delegated to.
    - Click on the `+` on the Add sRZR Token Header. Add the token to your wallet.

# Abstract

Decentralized technologies such as blockchain are revolutionizing many industries
including finance. Applications such as decentralized lending, stable currencies, prediction
markets, and synthetic assets are being researched and built on top of them. Many such
applications depend on real-world data, which is not readily available inside the blockchain
environment due to their design. Currently, this problem is being solved by something called
an “Oracle”, which is an entity that reads real-world data and feeds it to the blockchain.
Current Oracle solutions are either centralized or vulnerable to certain attacks. Current
oracle solutions may work short term but are not suitable for long term applications, which is
essential in decentralized applications.

In this paper, we propose a fully decentralized oracle network called "Razor network"
with built-in governance, so that the network can thwart such attacks and remain functional
in a constantly evolving environment. Razor network is resilient to bribing attacks since it
utilizes a high degree of redundancy and offers high economic security for all applications
regardless of the fees being paid to the oracle. Razor network also can dispute the results of
the oracle, which makes it resistant to many kinds of game theoretical vulnerabilities.

Razor network consists of stakers 1 who accept queries from a job queue, perform
fetching of information from the real-world, process and aggregate the results and serve
them to the requesting application. Stakers are awarded for reporting coherently and
penalized for reporting incoherently.

Razor network uses a proof of stake consensus algorithm and uses a native utility
token called RAZOR. RAZOR are needed to be locked to participate as a staker in the
network. Stakers are awarded fees as well as block rewards for participating in the network.
The amount of staked tokens of the staker determine their influence in the network.
The design goals of the Razor network are to ensure the long term sustainability of
the oracle and the data feeds it provides, a high degree of decentralization, high economic
security in a way that protects both stakers and clients of the oracle from various attacks.

# Design Goals

Design decisions have been made with the following goals in mind:
1. High Economic security
2. High degree of decentralization
3. Protection of stakers from various kinds of attacks
4. Protection of clients
5. Censorship resistance
6. Ease of use for developers
7. Collusion and Bribing attack resistance

## 1.3.1 High economic security
Economic security is simply the amount of financial resources required to
compromise a network. Any decentralized network can be compromised with high enough
financial resources. However, if the financial benefits of compromise are less than the cost, it
is unprofitable to attack the network, hence unlikely that anyone will attempt to do so.
Providing high economic security is one of the biggest design goals for this protocol.
There is a clear need for an oracle protocol that provides this feature. Providing high and
calculable economic security provides guarantees for applications to be secure until a
certain degree of economic value.
